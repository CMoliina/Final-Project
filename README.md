## Crypto Price Tracker App :iphone:
This is my final university project. 

 ***The idea is to show a list of fifty altcoins, see the charts of each one using CoinGecko API and save (or unsave) in Watchlist option your favorites coins. Also the users can read articles and breaking news headlines about crypto world. Another option is search news about business. All this using News API.***
